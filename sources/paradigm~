As Kuhn defines it, a paradigm is a set of theories, ideas, abstractions, beliefs that “provide models from which spring particular traditions of scientific research” (1996). Kuhn’s examples of paradigm shifts, which are primarily from the physical sciences, include Aristotelian dynamics, Copernicanastronomy, Newtonian optics, and Einstein’s theories of
relativity. A paradigm shift is a crisis brought on by conflict between two or more paradigms, in which the “fittest” paradigm survives. There is no synthesis: Kuhn claims that paradigms are incommensurable (incompatible), hence the crisis; the resulting change is comparable to a revolution. Implicit in this argument is the claim that science is an instrument for solving problems. Thus, Kuhn’s evolutionary and instrumental model of science calls into question the teleology (purpose) of the scientific enterprise. As Kuhn states, “we may...have to relinquish the notion...that changes of paradigm carry scientists closer and closer to the truth” (1996).
